The data is from [here](www.basketball-reference.com
                        Sample link for the data source: [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2017.html)
                        ??? missed_fg = missed field goals
                        ??? missed_ft = missed free throws
                        ??? points = total points
                        ??? rebounds = offensive rebounds + defensive rebounds
                        ??? efficiency = efficiency index
                        3
                        Recall that efficiency is given by:
                          efficiency = (points + rebounds + assists + steals + blocks
                                        - missed_fg - missed_ft - turnovers) / games_played
